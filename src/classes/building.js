/*------------------
You will be equally evaluated on the
quality of tests you write for this!

1. Create a file named `__building.js` and
add it to the `test` folder.
2. Create a class named Building. Export it,
and then import it into the test file. Hint: make
sure that the file path you use is correct (it won't
just be `../src/building`- this file is nested inside
a folder for `classes` as well).
3. Add two properties (your choice) and test them.
4. Add two methods (your choice) and test them.
