# Full Stack Development Test - Week Two

This assessment tests your understanding of classes, testing, and list-type data structures.

## Guidelines
  - Do not use any presentations from the class or any notes you have taken.
  - **You may NOT look at code you have previously written**.
  - The only resources you may use online are:
    - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
    - [Chai docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
  - Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips
  - Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
  - Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Self-Assessment
Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.
